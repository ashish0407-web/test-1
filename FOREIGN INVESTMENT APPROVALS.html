                                    <p>Foreign investment in India is predominantly regulated by the FDI policy established by the Secretariat for Industrial Assistance (SIA), the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB), and foreign exchange regulations overseen by the RBI. Under the current set of guidelines and rules, there are several channels through which foreign investment can be made in India:</p>
                                     <h4 class="title"><span class="spnHead"></span></h4>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>A. Through Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)</li>
                                        <li>B. Through Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs), directly using the Portfolio Investment Scheme (PIS)</li>
                                        <li>C. By Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) and Persons of Indian Origin (PIO), both directly and indirectly, utilizing the PIS</li>
                                        <li>D. By Qualified Foreign Investors, via the PIS</li>
                                        <li>E. By Foreign Venture Capital Investors (FVCIs).</li>

                                    <h4></h4>
                                    <p>Following the liberalization efforts in the 1980s and the implementation of the new industrial policy in 1991, significant policy adjustments were undertaken to dismantle bureaucratic obstacles, facilitating unrestricted movement of foreign capital and global trade. The Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) framework underwent gradual liberalization, primarily achieved by eliminating constraints on foreign investment and streamlining processes. Consequently, among the developing economies, India boasts one of the most open and clear foreign investment frameworks.</p>
                                    <h3>FDI policy</h3>
                                    
                                     <h4 class="title"><span class="spnHead">FDI Policy</span></h4>
                                                <p>The government of India releases a compendium of FDI policy every six months. Foreign investment in India can be made either through the automatic route or the approval route.<br />

                                                <p>Through the automatic route, there is no need for pre-existing regulatory clearance from either the RBI or FIPB. In this avenue, investors must inform the relevant regional branch of the RBI within 30 days of acquiring investment funds in India. Additionally, they must submit the necessary paperwork and particulars of the shares allocated to foreign investors to the same regional branch within 30 days of distributing these shares.</p>

Requests for foreign investments that require prior official approval should be lodged with the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB).</p>

                                    <!-- <p>Director General of Audit, has published services tax audit manual, 2010, 2010. As per the guidance, taxpayers whose annual service tax payment (including cash and cenvat) was Rs 30 million or more in the preceding financial year may be subjected to mandatory audit each year. It is preferable that audit of all such units is done by using computer assisted audit program (CAAP) techniques. The frequently of audit for other taxpayers would be as per following norms:.</p>
                                    <p>i. Taxpayers with service tax payment above Rs 30 million (cash+ cenvat) (mandatory units) to be audited every year.<br />
                                        ii. Taxpayer with service tax payment between Rs 10 million and Rs 30 million (cash+ cenvat) to be audited once every two years.<br />
                                        iii. Taxpayers with service tax payment between 2.5 million and 10 million (cash + cenvat) to be audited once every five year.<br />
                                        iv. Taxpayers with service tax payment up to 2.5 million (cash + cenvat) 2% of taxpayers to be audited every year.</p>
                                    <p>The audit selection guidelines, therefore would apply to the non-mandatory taxpayers, forming part of discretionary workload. These taxpayers should be selected on the basis of assessment of risk potential to the revenue. This process, which is an essential feature of audit selection, is known as Risk Assessment. It involves the ranking of taxpayers according to quantitative indicators of risk known as a “risk parameter”. It is also suggested that the taxpayers whose returns were selected for detailed scrutiny, the taxpayers who have been selected for audit, may not be taken up for detailed scrutiny of their ST-3 returns during that year.</p>
                                    <h4 class="title"><span class="spnHead">FOCUS OF AUDIT IN SERVICE TAX-BOOKS/RECORDS</span></h4>
                                    <p>The focus of audit in service tax matters is again to be seen from the revenue’s point of view. The objective is to find out whether there has been proper and appropriate payment of service tax by an assessee.</p>
                                    <h4 class="title"><span class="spnHead">BOOKS AND RECORDS FOR SERVICES TAX PURPOSES</span></h4>
                                    <p>It is an interesting to note that the Finance Act, 1994 or the Services Tax Rules, 1994 do not prescribe any set of books or records to be maintained by the service tax assessees. The assessees are free to maintained their own books/accounts. In fact rule 5 of the services tax rules, 1994 provides that the records including computerized data as maintained by an assessees in accordance with the various laws in force from time to time shall be acceptable to the Department. Accordingly, service tax assessees who are joint stock companies governed by the provisions of Companies Act, 2013 will maintain books/ accounts as prescribed under the Companies Act, 2013. Assessees who are registered under the Co-operative Societies Act or under the Societies Registration Act will maintain books/records under the respective rules/regulations framed under the laws governing the assessees. Similarly, assesses who are registered as Trust will maintain books/accounts as required of them under the law governing the trust, if any. Assessees who are receiving foreign contributions will maintain books/records specially required of them as prescribed under the Foreign Contributions Regulation Act /rules framed thereunder. Similarly sole traders and partnership firms will maintain accounts/books as required under the income tax /sales tax acts including work contracts and also as required under the Tax Audit rules under the Income Tax Act 1961 besides records under other tax laws and special statutes such as Insurance Laws, Banking Laws and Rules and Regulations framed thereunder. Normally service tax assessees maintain the following records:</p>
                                    <p>a) Invoice/bills showing the service charges/job work charges<br />

                                        e) Debit/Credit notes<br />
                                        f) Party’s ledger-debtors and creditors<br />

                                        k) Challans and other documents evidencing transport of goods by land, rail, air and connected documents such as L/R/, R/R, airway bill, bill of entry etc.<br />
                                        l) Trial Balance<br />
                                        m) Balance sheet along with schedules there under<br />
                                        n) Bills raised for services rendered<br />
                                        o) Contracts/agreements for various purposes such as for civil construction, manpower, supply, technical know-how/transfer, job work non-compete agreements etc.<br />
                                        p) MOUs<br />
                                        q) Purchase orders<br />
                                        r) Works orders</p>
                                    <h4 class="title"><span class="spnHead">The above are only illustrative and not exhaustive.</span></h4>
                                    <p>Now that over all services except those in the negative list and those services specifically exempted otherwise are brought under services tax net the books/records maintained by the service provider will vary depending upon the peculiarities of a particular service provider. For example, the records maintained by an air travel agent will be slightly different from the records maintained by consulting engineers or a maintenance/repairs services provider or a mandap keeper or a broker. Similarly the record maintained by the insurance company providing life/general insurance will be different from the records maintained by consignment agent of goods. In fact, in the case of such service providers such as stock brokers, life insurance companies, general insurance companies etc. there are special statutes governing their set up and operation and under these statutes they are required to maintain certain special type of records.</p>
                                    <p>Form the service tax point of view, for the purpose of audit every type of records is essential and relevant so as to ascertain whether value of taxable service has been correctly arrived at and tax has been paid properly in addition to finding out whether any taxable services has escaped from the levy. The service tax authorities are empowered to call for any books/records or other evidence which may be germane to ascertaining the fact whether the service tax liability has been properly and appropriately discharged or not?</p>
                                    <h4 class="title"><span class="spnHead">AUDIT UNDER NEGATIVE LIST BASED TAXATION</span></h4>
                                    <p>a) Every assessee has to understand that the terms “service” has been defined for the first time to mean any activity done for any consideration. It will also include service portion in the execution of works contacts pertaining to movable or immovable goods. It will not include actionable claims or any transaction in money. Similarly, service, rendered by a government, services rendered by constitutional authority/body, Member of Parliament, members of legislative assembly and services provided by an employee to the employer pursuant to a contractual employment are not within the scope of services. However, where a person works as an independent contractor where the relationship is one of contract for service, service tax will be attracted eg., a manpower supply services provider will be under contract for service and not contract of service. Similarly an AMC provider who is acting as an independent contractor will be providing service under contract for service. These are liable to service tax.<br />
                                        b) All declared services under sections 66E of the finance Act,1994 (chapter V) will attract service tax.<br />
                                        c) Mega exemption notification has to be studied carefully to ensure that an assesses is entitled to the benefits of the exemption.<br />
                                        d) Where partial exemption from value given in respect of certain services vide notification no 26/2012-ST dated 20-6-2012 the assesses should avail such partial exemption as per the notification including fulfilling of conditions prescribed therein.<br />
                                        e) Wherever reverse charge method of taxation has been prescribed vide notification no. 30/2012-ST dated 20-6-2012, service recipient has also to take care to pay service tax on the portion of the service for which he is liable to pay service to the government.<br />
                                        f) Service tax is payable on accrual basis with effect from 1-4-2011. Since there can be difference between the date of invoice, date of rendering the service and date of receipt of payment for the service. However, w.e.f 1-4-2011 receipt basis of taxation has been allowed by way of option to individuals and partnership firm if the aggregate value of services provided is Rs 50 lakhs or less in a financial year. Point of taxation rules has been introduced to define at what point of time service is deemed to be rendered. Understanding of these rules is very important because if there is any delay in payment by not properly appreciating these rules, interest will have to be paid.<br />
                                        g) Similarly, place of provision of service rules has been notified for the purpose of<br />
                                        deciding the place where the service is rendered.These rules are relevant for determining the following:<br />
                                        i) In which jurisdiction the service provider is required to be registered.<br />
                                        ii) Whether the service is rendered outside India or in India and if the service is rendered outside the territory of India it is not taxable as per rules.<br />
                                        iii) In the case of provision of services to SEZ unit the place of provision of service rules will apply and accordingly if the of provision of service is in the SEZ unit it will not be taxed.<br />
                                        iv) For determining whether in a given case service is exported or not.<br />
                                        Therefore a very clear understanding of the Place of Provision of Services Rules is necessary.</p>
                                    <p>h) Every taxable service has to be properly valued according to the valuation rules notified for this purpose. Now, there are elaborate rules prescribed for valuation<br />
                                        in respect of various types of services.<br />
                                        These rules have to be properly understood and appreciated.<br />
                                        i) Classification/ descriptions of service has to be properly understood because:<br />
                                        — It is the description or classification of service which determines whether reverse charge method of taxation is applicable or not in a given case.<br />
                                        — Whether benefit of any exemption granted can be availed or not depends upon on description/classification of service.<br />
                                        — Whether partial exemption from value can be availed or not depends upon description/classification of service.<br />
                                        j) Payment of service tax is to be done quarterly in the case of individual, sole trading concern and partnership firms.<br />
                                        k) Returns have to be filled on time indicating correct particulars therein.<br />
                                        l) Proper records have to be maintained by the assessees so that the same can be produced during inspection, audit so as to justify the assessees stand.<br />
                                        m) All confirmed payment of service tax has either to be paid or shall be agitated in appeal proceedings.</p>
                                    <p>If there are any mistakes apparent on record in any order passed by any authority the same has to be rectified by making an application in that behalf.</p>
                                    <p>Thus service tax assesses have to have a good grasp of the provision of service tax law contained in the Act/Rules notification issued by the Government. Circular issued by the Board also help in understanding the department’s view on a particular aspect though circular are binding on the departmental officers and not binding on the assessees. A fair knowledge of the law has laid down in various Tribunal Rules, High Court and Supreme Court will also help in proper compliance with the law and giving explanation during the audit by the officers attached to the department.</p>
                                    <h4 class="title"><span class="spnHead">Preparedness of assesses for service tax audit</span></h4>
                                    <p>All service tax assesses should tend to be well prepared for facing the audit by ensuring the following:-</p>
                                    <p>a) Keeping their books/records up to date and tidy with supporting documents.<br />
                                        b) Ensuring that they are registered for all taxable services being provided by them whether in their capacity as service provider or in their capacity as service receiver.<br />
                                        c) Where service tax registration has not been obtained for any category of service the same should be applied for and the existing registrations should be got amended suitably.<br />
                                        d) Whether service provider has ceased to provide any service he should have applied for cancelling of service tax registration.<br />
                                        e) Proper records must be maintained for various invoices issued for service tax purposes.<br />
                                        f) Generally service tax invoices should be running on serial number for the whole year and only one series of invoice should be maintained normally.<br />
                                        g) Proof of deposit of service tax in the form of challan generated on the computer or deposited in the bank must be kept properly on the file.<br />
                                        h) All service tax has to be properly prepared and filed and kept on record.<br />
                                        i) A review of all transaction other than goods must be undertaken to see whether any of those transaction attracts service tax. Normally activities on which excise duty or VAT has been paid do not attract service tax.<br />
                                        j) All payment made under foreign exchange should be scrutinized to see whether any payment related to service received form non-resident in which case reverse charge method of taxation will be applicable.<br />

                                    <p><b>Thus the Audit team will closely examine—</b></p>
                                    <p>Firstly, as to whether the services have been provided in India and If used whether tax has been paid or not?<br />
                                        Secondly, in respect of certain services for which payment has been received in convertible foreign exchange, the audit team will examine whether the service in the instant case has been provided outside India and constitute export?<br />
                                        Thirdly, whether the service provider has claimed any exemption in respect of services provided in SEZ Zone or to a SEZ Unit in its location, whether the service has been so actually provided there at the SEZ/SEZ unit?<br />
                                        Fourthly, whether in respect of certain services provided in the state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir, the Rule prescribed have been applied correctly or not by the assessee so as to justify the tax not having been paid thereon?<br />
                                        Fifthly, whether in respect of import of service, tax has been paid in India under the reverse charge method because in the case of import, place of provision of Service is India.<br />
