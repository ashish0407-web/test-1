                                    <p>The operation of the internal audit function should comply with the following code:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><b>Formal Charter:</b> The internal audit function should have formal charter, including terms of reference, which has been approved by board;</li>
                                        <li><b>Documentation of Reporting Structure:</b> The reporting structure for internal audit should be clear and formally documented. The head of the internal audit function should have considerable seniority within the organization and the content of all internal audit report should be entirely at his discretion. The head of internal audit should report directly to the board audit committee and should also have access to the chairman of the board and the chairman of the board audit committee. Functionally the head of internal audit should report within the body to such person as the board decides and to the chief executive;</li>

Conversely the internal audit function could provide the external auditor with company specific expertise to assist in the evaluation of the system being examined as part of the statutory audit)</li>
                                        <li><b>Audit committee and external auditors:</b> The Board audit committee should make the external auditor aware of corporate governance issues outlined in this documents with which the state body is required to comply.

                                            3. Relationship between Internal and External Audit</span></h4>
                                    <p>As per AAS-7 on relying upon the work of an internal auditor, the external auditor should as a part of his audit evaluate the internal audit function to the extent he considers that it will be relevant in determining the nature, timing and extent of his audit procedures. The scope and objectives of an internal auditor are determined by the management while the external auditor has to carry out his functions under some statutory requirement Nevertheless, some of the means of achieving their respective objectives are often similar and thus, much of the work of internal auditor may be useful to the external auditor on determining the nature, timing and extend on the procedures. The external auditor should also evaluate the internal audit function to determine the extent of compliance of the substantive and compliance procedures. It is to be noted that the degree of independence an external auditor has it not with the internal auditor and hence, the report of external auditor is his sole responsibility and the fact that he has relied on the work of internal auditor does not in any way absolve him of his reporting responsibility.</p>
                                    <h4 class="title"><span class="spnHead"><br />
                                            Making Internal Audit Effective:</span></h4>
                                    <p>Once the external audit has decided to place reliance on the work of internal auditor, he should coordinate with him, i.e., he should ascertain the internal auditor’s tentative plan for the year ,discuss with him the areas of possible reliance, the extent of internal audit coverage, test methods, methods of sample selection of documentation and review.</p>
                                    <p>Further, the external auditor should be granted access to the internal audit reports and be kept informed of any significant matter which comes to internal auditor’s attention. Similarly, the external auditor should ordinarily inform the internal auditor of any significant matters which may affect his work.</p>
                                    <p>The External auditor should take into account the following factors in relying on the work of internal auditor:</p>
                                    <p>(a) The adequacy of audit programmes in relation to the scope of audit report.<br />
                                        (b) The planning of the work ,supervision and review of the documentation of the assistants;<br />
                                        (c) The availability of sufficient appropriate audit evidence.<br />
                                        (d) The appropriateness of conclusion reached and the report thereon.<br />
                                        (e) Any expectations or unusual matters disclosed by the internal audit.</p>

                                            4. Evaluating Internal Audit Function</span></h4>
                                    <p><b>1.</b> The important aspects that may be considered by the external auditor while evaluating the internal audit function are as follow:</p>
                                    <p><b>(a) Organization Status:</b> The external auditor should consider any constraints or restrictions placed by the management as regards the reporting by the internal auditor;</p>
                                    <p><b>(b) Scope of Function:</b> The nature and depth of audit coverage should be ascertained by the external auditor along with whether the management acts upon the recommendations of the internal auditor;</p>
                                    <p><b>(c) Technical Competence:</b> Here the professional competence of the internal auditor should be evaluated;</p>
                                    <p><b>(d) Due Professional Experience:</b> The external auditor should ascertain whether the internal audit work has been properly planned, supervised, review and documented.</p>
                                    <p><b>2.</b> To facilitate the accumulation of the information necessary for the proper review and evaluation of internal controls, the auditor can use one of the following to help him to know, assimilate and evaluate the same:</p>
                                    <p><b>(a) Narrative Record:</b> This is a complete and exhaustive description of the system as found in operation by the auditor. Actual testing and observation and necessary before such a record can be developed. It may be recommended in cases where no formal control system is in operation and would be more suited to small business. Further, it allows flexibility and can be adapted to any type of enterprise. The narrative record help in the comprehending the system operation, identify the weakness of the system and incorporating the necessary changes in the system.</p>
                                    <p><b>(b) Check List:</b> This is a series of introduction or question which a member of auditing staff must follow to answer. When he completes the instruction he must initial the space against each instruction or question. For example, the following check list pertains to the purchase function of a company:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Is purchasing the exclusive responsibilities of purchase department?</li>
                                        <li>Is purchase made on the basis of a written order? If yes, whether the purchase form standardized?</li>
                                        <li>Are purchases also made on behalf of employees, director etc?</li>
                                        <li>Is special approval necessary where any purchase is not based on the lowest quoted price?</li>
                                        <li>Is there any special authorization needed for variation in the terms of a purchase order?</li>
                                        <li>Are the copies of purchase order also sent to the accounts department and other store department?</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p><b>3. Internal Control Questionnaire:</b> This is a comprehensive series of question concerning internal controls. This is the most widely used form for collecting information about the existence, operational efficiency of internal control in an organization. The auditor may prepare a standard questionnaire to be used with suitable modification in the case of all audit engagements or he may prepare a fresh one for each audit engagement. The question should be designed that answer can be provided by a mere ticking of the words, “yes” or “no” or “ not applicable” .Questionnaires are generally favored in case of audit of large enterprises because a considerable amount of time is saved for the auditor by eliminating the need for preparing a program for each engagement.</p>
                                    <p><b>4. Flow Chart:</b> It is a graphic presentation of each part of company’s system of internal control. A flow chart is considered to be the most concise way of recording the auditor’s review of the system of the system. It minimizes the time involved in getting narrative explanation and gives bird’s eye view of the system.</p>
                                    <p>It is to be noted all of the above mentioned techniques to evaluated internal controls can be effective only if the auditor has an understanding of the client’s business.</p>

                                    <p>Director General of Audit, has published services tax audit manual, 2010, 2010. As per the guidance, taxpayers whose annual service tax payment (including cash and cenvat) was Rs 30 million or more in the preceding financial year may be subjected to mandatory audit each year. It is preferable that audit of all such units is done by using computer assisted audit program (CAAP) techniques. The frequently of audit for other taxpayers would be as per following norms:.</p>
                                    <p>i. Taxpayers with service tax payment above Rs 30 million (cash+ cenvat) (mandatory units) to be audited every year.<br />
                                        ii. Taxpayer with service tax payment between Rs 10 million and Rs 30 million (cash+ cenvat) to be audited once every two years.<br />
                                        iii. Taxpayers with service tax payment between 2.5 million and 10 million (cash + cenvat) to be audited once every five year.<br />
                                        iv. Taxpayers with service tax payment up to 2.5 million (cash + cenvat) 2% of taxpayers to be audited every year.</p>
                                    <p>The audit selection guidelines, therefore would apply to the non-mandatory taxpayers, forming part of discretionary workload. These taxpayers should be selected on the basis of assessment of risk potential to the revenue. This process, which is an essential feature of audit selection, is known as Risk Assessment. It involves the ranking of taxpayers according to quantitative indicators of risk known as a “risk parameter”. It is also suggested that the taxpayers whose returns were selected for detailed scrutiny, the taxpayers who have been selected for audit, may not be taken up for detailed scrutiny of their ST-3 returns during that year.</p>
                                    <h4 class="title"><span class="spnHead">FOCUS OF AUDIT IN SERVICE TAX-BOOKS/RECORDS</span></h4>
                                    <p>The focus of audit in service tax matters is again to be seen from the revenue’s point of view. The objective is to find out whether there has been proper and appropriate payment of service tax by an assessee.</p>
                                    <h4 class="title"><span class="spnHead">BOOKS AND RECORDS FOR SERVICES TAX PURPOSES</span></h4>
                                    <p>It is an interesting to note that the Finance Act, 1994 or the Services Tax Rules, 1994 do not prescribe any set of books or records to be maintained by the service tax assessees. The assessees are free to maintained their own books/accounts.

                                    <h4 class="title"><span class="spnHead">The above are only illustrative and not exhaustive.</span></h4>
                                    <p>Now that over all services except those in the negative list and those services specifically exempted otherwise are brought under services tax net the books/records maintained by the service provider will vary depending upon the peculiarities of a particular service provider. For example, the records maintained by an air travel agent will be slightly different from the records maintained by consulting engineers or a maintenance/repairs services provider or a mandap keeper or a broker. Similarly the record maintained by the insurance company providing life/general insurance will be different from the records maintained by consignment agent of goods. In fact, in the case of such service providers such as stock brokers, life insurance companies, general insurance companies etc. there are special statutes governing their set up and operation and under these statutes they are required to maintain certain special type of records.</p>
                                    <p>Form the service tax point of view, for the purpose of audit every type of records is essential and relevant so as to ascertain whether value of taxable service has been correctly arrived at and tax has been paid properly in addition to finding out whether any taxable services has escaped from the levy. The service tax authorities are empowered to call for any books/records or other evidence which may be germane to ascertaining the fact whether the service tax liability has been properly and appropriately discharged or not?</p>
                                    <h4 class="title"><span class="spnHead">AUDIT UNDER NEGATIVE LIST BASED TAXATION</span></h4>
                                    <p>a) Every assessee has to understand that the terms “service” has been defined for the first time to mean any activity done for any consideration. It will also include service portion in the execution of works contacts pertaining to movable or immovable goods. It will not include actionable claims or any transaction in money. Similarly, service, rendered by a government, services rendered by constitutional authority/body, Member of Parliament, members of legislative assembly and services provided by an employee to the employer pursuant to a contractual employment are not within the scope of services. However, where a person works as an independent contractor where the relationship is one of contract for service, service tax will be attracted eg., a manpower supply services provider will be under contract for service and not contract of service. Similarly an AMC provider who is acting as an independent contractor will be providing service under contract for service. These are liable to service tax.<br />
                                        b) All declared services under sections 66E of the finance Act,1994 (chapter V) will attract service tax.<br />
                                        c) Mega exemption notification has to be studied carefully to ensure that an assesses is entitled to the benefits of the exemption.<br />
                                        d) Where partial exemption from value given in respect of certain services vide notification no 26/2012-ST dated 20-6-2012 the assesses should avail such partial exemption as per the notification including fulfilling of conditions prescribed therein.<br />
                                        e) Wherever reverse charge method of taxation has been prescribed vide notification no. 30/2012-ST dated 20-6-2012, service recipient has also to take care to pay service tax on the portion of the service for which he is liable to pay service to the government.<br />
                                        f) Service tax is payable on accrual basis with effect from 1-4-2011. Since there can be difference between the date of invoice, date of rendering the service and date of receipt of payment for the service. However, w.e.f 1-4-2011 receipt basis of taxation has been allowed by way of option to individuals and partnership firm if the aggregate value of services provided is Rs 50 lakhs or less in a financial year. Point of taxation rules has been introduced to define at what point of time service is deemed to be rendered. Understanding of these rules is very important because if there is any delay in payment by not properly appreciating these rules, interest will have to be paid.<br />
                                        g) Similarly, place of provision of service rules has been notified for the purpose of<br />
                                        deciding the place where the service is rendered.These rules are relevant for determining the following:<br />
                                        i) In which jurisdiction the service provider is required to be registered.<br />
                                        ii) Whether the service is rendered outside India or in India and if the service is rendered outside the territory of India it is not taxable as per rules.<br />
                                        iii) In the case of provision of services to SEZ unit the place of provision of service rules will apply and accordingly if the of provision of service is in the SEZ unit it will not be taxed.<br />
                                        iv) For determining whether in a given case service is exported or not.<br />
                                        Therefore a very clear understanding of the Place of Provision of Services Rules is necessary.</p>
                                    <p>h) Every taxable service has to be properly valued according to the valuation rules notified for this purpose. Now, there are elaborate rules prescribed for valuation<br />
                                        in respect of various types of services.<br />
                                        These rules have to be properly understood and appreciated.<br />
                                        i) Classification/ descriptions of service has to be properly understood because:<br />
                                        — It is the description or classification of service which determines whether reverse charge method of taxation is applicable or not in a given case.<br />
                                        — Whether benefit of any exemption granted can be availed or not depends upon on description/classification of service.<br />
                                        — Whether partial exemption from value can be availed or not depends upon description/classification of service.<br />
                                        j) Payment of service tax is to be done quarterly in the case of individual, sole trading concern and partnership firms.<br />
                                        k) Returns have to be filled on time indicating correct particulars therein.<br />
                                        l) Proper records have to be maintained by the assessees so that the same can be produced during inspection, audit so as to justify the assessees stand.<br />
                                        m) All confirmed payment of service tax has either to be paid or shall be agitated in appeal proceedings.</p>
                                    <p>If there are any mistakes apparent on record in any order passed by any authority the same has to be rectified by making an application in that behalf.</p>
                                    <p>Thus service tax assesses have to have a good grasp of the provision of service tax law contained in the Act/Rules notification issued by the Government. Circular issued by the Board also help in understanding the department’s view on a particular aspect though circular are binding on the departmental officers and not binding on the assessees. A fair knowledge of the law has laid down in various Tribunal Rules, High Court and Supreme Court will also help in proper compliance with the law and giving explanation during the audit by the officers attached to the department.</p>
                                    <h4 class="title"><span class="spnHead">Preparedness of assesses for service tax audit</span></h4>
                                    <p>All service tax assesses should tend to be well prepared for facing the audit by ensuring the following:-</p>
                                    <p>a) Keeping their books/records up to date and tidy with supporting documents.<br />

                                        c) Where service tax registration has not been obtained for any category of service the same should be applied for and the existing registrations should be got amended suitably.<br />
                                        d) Whether service provider has ceased to provide any service he should have applied for cancelling of service tax registration.<br />
                                        e) Proper records must be maintained for various invoices issued for service tax purposes.<br />
                                        f) Generally service tax invoices should be running on serial number for the whole year and only one series of invoice should be maintained normally.<br />
                                        g) Proof of deposit of service tax in the form of challan generated on the computer or deposited in the bank must be kept properly on the file.<br />
                                        h) All service tax has to be properly prepared and filed and kept on record.<br />
                                        i) A review of all transaction other than goods must be undertaken to see whether any of those transaction attracts service tax. Normally activities on which excise duty or VAT has been paid do not attract service tax.<br />
                                        j) All payment made under foreign exchange should be scrutinized to see whether any payment related to service received form non-resident in which case reverse charge method of taxation will be applicable.<br />
                                        k) All receipt of foreign exchange may be scrutinized to see whether any receipt is for service rendered to non-resident which are normally not taxable being treated as export of service.<br />
                                        l) In the case of works contract proper valuation has to be done as per rules.<br />
                                        m) All debit/credit notes issued must be examined to see to service tax implication flowing therefore.<br />
                                        n) CENVAT credit records should be kept up to date.<br />
                                        o) CENVAT credit should be taken only on eligible inputs/eligible input services and eligible capital goods.<br />
                                        p) Utilization of services tax credit must be in accordance with the CENVAT credit rules 2004.</p>
                                    <p>Generally well before the commencement of the audit by the department a thorough review has to be undertaken by the assesses to get well prepared to meet the queries that may be raised by the audit team by focusing inter alia on the above aspects. The list above is not exhaustive but only illustrative.</p>

                                    <p>Firstly, as to whether the services have been provided in India and If used whether tax has been paid or not?<br />
                                        Secondly, in respect of certain services for which payment has been received in convertible foreign exchange, the audit team will examine whether the service in the instant case has been provided outside India and constitute export?<br />

                                        Fifthly, whether in respect of import of service, tax has been paid in India under the reverse charge method because in the case of import, place of provision of Service is India.<br />
